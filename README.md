# LaunchDarkly Sample C++ Client-Side Application
We've built a simple console application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works. Below, you'll find the basic build procedure, but for more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your Quickstart page. Use this as a starting point for integrating the c-client-sdk with your application.

## Build instructions
* Copy your Mobile SDK key and feature flag key from your LaunchDarkly dashboard into hello.cpp
* Download the latest SDK for your platform with fetch-linux.sh, fetch-mac.sh, or fetch-windows.ps1
* Build for your platform with build-linux.sh, build-mac.sh, or build-windows.ps1
* Run ./hello
